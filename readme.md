Lightweight Intelligent Intrusion Detection System (LIIDS) for Wireless Sensor Networks
Using Deep Autoencoders

Implementation of MSc thesis framework by Salisu Gaya, ZUBAIRU
Department of Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering
Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria

This implementation includes:
1. Data preprocessing for NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 datasets
2. Deep autoencoder model architecture with optimal hyperparameters
3. Training with resource optimization (early stopping, bottleneck compression)
4. Evaluation metrics (accuracy, recall, false alarm rate)
5. Energy and bandwidth efficiency analysis
6. Synthetic dataset generation and evaluation
